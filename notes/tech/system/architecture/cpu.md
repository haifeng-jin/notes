# CPU
* Interruption can be triggered by CPU. For example, a key is pressed on keyboard.
* CPU and RAM do not need drivers.


## Program Counter (PC)

Program counter (PC) is a componenet of CPU. It points to an address (in main memory) that contains the next instruction to be executed.

## Register File
The register file is a set of registers (storage devices) of word length.

## Arithmetic/Logic Unit (ALU)

Arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) is a componenet of CPU.
The ALU do operations on the specified registers.

## Bus Interface

Bus interface is a componenet of CPU.
It accepts the information from the buses.
For example, a key is pressed.

## Examples of CPU instructions

* Load: Copy from main memory to register.
* Store: Copy from register to main memory.
* Operate: Copy the content of 2 registers to ALU and performan an operation and write the result to one of the registers.
* Jump: Extract a word from a instruction and put into PC.
