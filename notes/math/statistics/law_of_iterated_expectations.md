# Law of Iterated Expectations

It is also know as LIE.
X is a random variable.
Y is another variable.
We have:

$$
\operatorname {E} (X)=\operatorname {E} (\operatorname {E} (X\mid Y))
$$

In $\operatorname {E} (X\mid Y)$, $Y$ is a specific value.
In $\operatorname {E} (\operatorname {E} (X\mid Y))$,
we need to enumerate all the possible value of $Y$ and multiply $\operatorname {E} (X\mid Y)$ with the corresponding probability of that $Y$ and sum together.
Therefore, they are equal.
