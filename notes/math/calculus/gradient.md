# Gradient

Gradient is about calculating the partial derivative of a function with several input variables.
The gradient of a function $f\colon \mathbb {R} ^{n}\to \mathbb {R}$ is usually written as $\nabla f$.
Gradient is a function $\nabla f\colon \mathbb {R} ^{n}\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}$.
Therefore, it is actually a [vector field](vector_field.md).
Its value at point $p=(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})$ is

$$
\nabla f(p)={\begin{bmatrix}{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x_{1}}}(p)\\\vdots \\{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x_{n}}}(p)\end{bmatrix}}.
$$
