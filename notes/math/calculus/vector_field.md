# Vector Field
It is a function $f$ mapping one Euclidean space to another Euclidean space.
$$
f\colon \mathbf {R} ^{n}\to \mathbf {R} ^{m}
$$

It is called a vector field because we can imagine it like that each point in the $\mathbf {R} ^{n}$ is assigned with an vector of $\mathbf {R} ^{m}$.
It is a space of vectors, which is called a vector field.
