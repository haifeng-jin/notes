# Integral

It can be seen as the area under the curve.
Calculating the integral of a function can be considered as calculating the "antiderivative".
Given the derivative of a function we have infinite number of "antiderivative" functions since moving a function curve vertically does not affect its derivative function.
For convenience, we can always think an integral function as the one which has its $f(0)=0$ by moving it vertically.
