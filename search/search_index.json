Take a look at the following, oversimplified example.</p> <pre><code>public class Foo {\n\n    private int id;\n\n    private double value;\n\n    public Foo(int id, double value) {\n     this.id = id;\n     this.value = value;\n    }\n\n    public int getId() {\n     return id;\n    }\n\n    public double getValue() {\n     return value;\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Take the following factory method, which creates a Foo.

But we are missing some context that would help. The default toString() implementation doesn\u2019t build any data about the members of the object. We have some options here, but let\u2019s have the IDE generate an implementation for us.</p> <pre><code>@Override\n    public String toString() {\n     return \"Foo [id=\" + id + \", value=\" + value + \"]\";\n    }\n</code></pre> <p>Run our test again:</p> <pre><code>2017-02-15 17:13:06,032 [main] DEBUG com.stackifytest.logging.FooFactory: Creating a Foo\n2017-02-15 17:13:06,041 [main] DEBUG com.stackifytest.logging.FooFactory: Foo [id=1, value=33.0]\n2017-02-15 17:13:06,041 [main] DEBUG com.stackifytest.logging.FooFactory: Creating a Foo\n2017-02-15 17:13:06,043 [main] ERROR com.stackifytest.logging.FooFactory:\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n    at com.stackifytest.logging.FooFactory.createFoo(FooFactory.java:15)\n    at com.stackifytest.logging.FooFactoryTest.test(FooFactoryTest.java:11)\n</code></pre> <p>Much better!

Know who the user was is the sort of context that is priceless in being able to quickly resolve an issue. Think about what other detail might be useful \u2013 for example, HttpWebRequest details.

When you do need the debug info, it\u2019s only changing a config file and not redeploying code. Second, if you\u2019re logging in an async, non-blocking way, then overhead should be low. Last, if you\u2019re worried about space and log file rotation, there are smarter ways to do it, and we\u2019ll talk about that in the next section.</p>"},{"location":"tech/software_engineering/java_log_best_practices/#work-smarter-not-harder","title":"Work Smarter, Not Harder","text":"<p>Now that we\u2019re logging everything, and it\u2019s providing more contextual data, we\u2019re going to look at the next part of the equation. As I\u2019ve mentioned, and demonstrated, just dumping all of this out to flat files still doesn\u2019t help you out a lot in a large, complex application and environment. Factor in thousands of requests, files spanning multiple days, weeks, or longer, and across multiple servers, you have to consider how you are going to quickly find the data that you need.</p> <p>What we all really need is a solution that provides:</p> <ul> <li>Aggregates all Log &amp; Exception data to one place</li> <li>Makes it available, instantly, to everyone on your team</li> <li>Presents a timeline of logging throughout your entire stack/infrastructure</li> <li>Is highly indexed and searchable by being in a  structured format This is the part where I tell you about Stackify Retrace. As we sought to improve our own abilities to quickly and efficiently work with our log data, we decided to make it a core part of our product (yes, we use Stackify to monitor Stackify) and share with our customers, since we believe it\u2019s an issue central to application troubleshooting.</li> </ul> <p>First, we realize that lots of developers already have logging in place, and aren\u2019t going to want to take a lot of time to rip that code out and put new code in. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve created logging appenders for the most common Java logging frameworks.</p> <p>Continuing with log4j as a sample, the setup is easy. Just add the Stackify appender to your project\u2019s maven pom file.</p> <pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n   &lt;groupId&gt;com.stackify&lt;/groupId&gt;\n   &lt;artifactId&gt;stackify-log-log4j12&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n   &lt;version&gt;1.1.9&lt;/version&gt;\n   &lt;scope&gt;runtime&lt;/scope&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Also, add in some configuration for the Stackify appender to your logging.properties file.</p> <pre><code>log4j.rootLogger=DEBUG, CONSOLE, STACKIFY\n\nlog4j.appender.CONSOLE=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender\n\nlog4j.appender.CONSOLE.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout\nlog4j.appender.CONSOLE.layout.ConversionPattern=%d [%t] %-5p %c: %m%n\n\nlog4j.appender.STACKIFY=com.stackify.log.log4j12.StackifyLogAppender\nlog4j.appender.STACKIFY.apiKey=[HIDDEN]\nlog4j.appender.STACKIFY.application=test-logging\nlog4j.appender.STACKIFY.environment=test\n</code></pre> <p>As you can see, if you\u2019re already using a different appender, you can keep it in place and put them side-by-side. Now that you\u2019ve got your logs streaming to Stackify we can take a look at the logging dashboard. (By the way, if our monitoring agent is installed, you can also send Syslog entries to Stackify as well!)</p> <p> This dashboard shows a consolidated stream of log data, coming from all your servers and apps, presented in a timeline.

See the search box at the top of the page? I can put in any search string that I can think of, and it will query all my logs as if it were a flat file. As we discussed earlier, however, this isn\u2019t great because you could end up with a lot more matches than you want. Suppose that I want to search for all objects with an id of 5. Fortunately, our log aggregator is smart enough to help in this situation. That\u2019s because when we find serialized objects in logs, we index each and every field we find.

If we have different salary strategies for different employees. Several types of employees may share the same salary strategy. The subclasses of Employee should not just override a function of calculateSalary(), but have a member of PayType which is an interface. Then we have different classes implementing the interface for different calculation for salaries. http://www.newthinktank.com/2013/01/code-refactoring-7/</p> <p>Template pattern is used to simplify the code for several classes has common operations, but some of them may omit some steps of the operations. http://www.newthinktank.com/2013/01/code-refactoring-8/</p> <p>If we have an instance of the subclass, call a function of the superclass g(). The superclass function g() call a override function f(). The f() would be the one in the subclass instead of in the super class.

The Builder has a bunch of methods, each of which set one of the attributes. Builder is an abstract class. There should be different kinds of builder extending the Builder class. Each kind of builder is used to make a specific kind of sandwich. The subBuilder would implement the methods to set a specific value to the sandwich attributes. There should be an Artist class which calls the Builder's methods in order to make the sandwich. http://www.newthinktank.com/2013/01/code-refactoring-10/ </p> <p>The difference between Builder and Template is as follows. Builders are subclasses extending the sandwich builder class to set different values to variables in Sandwich. Templates need a bunch of subclasses of Sandwich each of which override the functions of Sandwich to set the values. In one word, Builder is for more complicated objects.</p> <p>There is also a way to use Builder pattern to build Composite pattern.</p> <p>Using builder pattern is also a way to decouple the unit tests from he constructor of the classes. The most typical case is like this. One class is representing one row of data in the database table, whose constructor takes all the parameters to fill in each column of the row. The database is subject to change. So the constructor is subject to change. If we use the constructor in unit tests, when we wanna change the database schema, it is not easy to do, because we need to change all the unit tests which used that class. In stead of using the constructor we should use builder pattern.</p> <p>The builder pattern can also return \"this\" for every set operation. http://www.javaworld.com/article/2074938/core-java/too-many-parameters-in-java-methods-part-3-builder-pattern.html http://rdafbn.blogspot.com/2012/07/step-builder-pattern_28.html This is also know as the step-builder.</p>"},{"location":"tech/software_engineering/uml/","title":"Unified Modeling Language","text":""},{"location":"tech/software_engineering/unit_testing/","title":"Unit Testing","text":"<p>Unit tests should be simple, readable, and behavior-driven.

In this post, I'll share 10 tips and tricks for using GDB to debug most efficiently.</p> <p>I'll be using the Linux kernel for examples throughout this post, not because these examples are necessarily realistic, but because it's a large C codebase that I know and that anyone can download and take a look at. Don't worry if you aren't familiar with Linux's source in particular -- the details of the examples won't matter too much.</p> <ol> <li> <p><code>break WHERE if COND</code></p> </li> <li> <p>If you've ever used gdb, you almost certainly know about the \"breakpoint\" command, which lets you break at some specified point in the debugged program.</p> </li> <li> <p>But did you know that you can set conditional breakpoints? If you add <code>if CONDITION</code> to a breakpoint command, you can include an expression to be evaluated whenever the program reaches that point, and the program will only be stopped if the condition is fulfilled. Suppose I was debugging the Linux kernel and wanted to stop whenever init got scheduled. I could do:</p> </li> </ol> <pre><code>(gdb) break context_switch if next == init_task\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>Note that the condition is evaluated by gdb, not by the debugged program, so you still pay the cost of the target stopping and switching to gdb every time the breakpoint is hit. As such, they still slow the target down in relation to to how often the target location is hit, not how often the condition is met.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>command</code></p> </li> <li> <p>In addition to conditional breakpoints, the <code>command</code> command lets you specify commands to be run every time you hit a breakpoint. This can be used for a number of things, but one of the most basic is to augment points in a program to include debug output, without having to recompile and restart the program. I could get a minimal log of every <code>mmap()</code> operation performed on a system using:</p> </li> </ol> <pre><code>(gdb) b do_mmap_pgoff \nBreakpoint 1 at 0xffffffff8111a441: file mm/mmap.c, line 940.\n(gdb) command 1\nType commands for when breakpoint 1 is hit, one per line.\nEnd with a line saying just \"end\".\n&gt;print addr\n&gt;print len\n&gt;print prot\n&gt;end\n(gdb)\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p><code>gdb --args</code></p> </li> <li> <p>This one is simple, but a huge timesaver if you didn't know it. If you just want to start a program under gdb, passing some arguments on the command line, you can just build your command-line like usual, and then put \"gdb --args\" in front to launch gdb with the target program and the argument list both set:</p> </li> </ol> <pre><code>[~]$ gdb --args pizzamaker --deep-dish --toppings=pepperoni\n...\n(gdb) show args\nArgument list to give program being debugged when it is started is\n  \" --deep-dish --toppings=pepperoni\".\n(gdb) b main\nBreakpoint 1 at 0x45467c: file oven.c, line 123.\n(gdb) run\n...\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>I find this especially useful if I want to debug a project that has some arcane wrapper script that assembles lots of environment variables and possibly arguments before launching the actual binary (I'm looking at you, libtool). Instead of trying to replicate all that state and then launch gdb, simply make a copy of the wrapper, find the final \"exec\" call or similar, and add \"gdb --args\" in front.</p> </li> <li> <p>Finding source files</p> </li> <li> <p>I run Ubuntu, so I can download debug symbols for most of the packages on my system from ddebs.ubuntu.com, and I can get source using <code>apt-get source</code>. But how do I tell gdb to put the two together? If the debug symbols include relative paths, I can use gdb's <code>directory</code> command to add the source directory to my source path:</p> </li> </ol> <pre><code>[~/src]$ apt-get source coreutils\n[~/src]$ sudo apt-get install coreutils-dbgsym\n[~/src]$ gdb /bin/ls\nGNU gdb (GDB) 7.1-ubuntu\n(gdb) list main\n1192    ls.c: No such file or directory.\n    in ls.c\n(gdb) directory ~/src/coreutils-7.4/src/\nSource directories searched: /home/nelhage/src/coreutils-7.4:$cdir:$cwd\n(gdb) list main\n1192        }\n1193    }\n1194    \n1195    int\n1196    main (int argc, char **argv)\n1197    {\n1198      int i;\n1199      struct pending *thispend;\n1200      int n_files;\n1201\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Sometimes, however, debug symbols end up with absolute paths, such as the kernel's. In that case, I can use <code>set substitute-path</code> to tell gdb how to translate paths:</li> </ol> <pre><code>[~/src]$ apt-get source linux-image-2.6.32-25-generic\n[~/src]$ sudo apt-get install linux-image-2.6.32-25-generic-dbgsym\n[~/src]$ gdb /usr/lib/debug/boot/vmlinux-2.6.32-25-generic \n(gdb) list schedule\n5519    /build/buildd/linux-2.6.32/kernel/sched.c: No such file or directory.\n    in /build/buildd/linux-2.6.32/kernel/sched.c\n(gdb) set substitute-path /build/buildd/linux-2.6.32 /home/nelhage/src/linux-2.6.32/\n(gdb) list schedule\n5519    \n5520    static void put_prev_task(struct rq *rq, struct task_struct *p)\n5521    {\n5522        u64 runtime = p-&gt;se.sum_exec_runtime - p-&gt;se.prev_sum_exec_runtime;\n5523    \n5524        update_avg(&amp;p-&gt;se.avg_running, runtime);\n5525    \n5526        if (p-&gt;state == TASK_RUNNING) {\n5527            /*\n5528             * In order to avoid avg_overlap growing stale when we are\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>Debugging macros</p> </li> <li> <p>One of the standard reasons almost everyone will tell you to prefer inline functions over macros is that debuggers tend to be better at dealing with inline functions. And in fact, by default, gdb doesn't know anything at all about macros, even when your project was built with debug symbols:</p> </li> </ol> <pre><code>(gdb) p GFP_ATOMIC\nNo symbol \"GFP_ATOMIC\" in current context.\n(gdb) p task_is_stopped(&amp;init_task)\nNo symbol \"task_is_stopped\" in current context.\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>However, if you're willing to tell GCC to generate debug symbols specifically optimized for gdb, using <code>-ggdb3</code>, it can preserve this information:</li> </ol> <pre><code>$ make KCFLAGS=-ggdb3\n...\n(gdb) break schedule\n(gdb) continue\n(gdb) p/x GFP_ATOMIC\n$1 = 0x20\n(gdb) p task_is_stopped_or_traced(init_task)\n$2 = 0\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>You can also use the <code>macro</code> and <code>info macro</code> commands to work with macros from inside your gdb session:</li> </ol> <pre><code>(gdb) macro expand task_is_stopped_or_traced(init_task)\nexpands to: ((init_task-&gt;state &amp; (4 | 8)) != 0)\n(gdb) info macro task_is_stopped_or_traced\nDefined at include/linux/sched.h:218\n  included at include/linux/nmi.h:7\n  included at kernel/sched.c:31\n#define task_is_stopped_or_traced(task) ((task-&gt;state &amp; (__TASK_STOPPED | __TASK_TRACED)) != 0)\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>Note that gdb actually knows which contexts macros are and aren't visible, so when you have the program stopped inside some function, you can only access macros visible at that point. (You can see that the \"included at\" lines above show you through exactly what path the macro is visible).</p> </li> <li> <p>gdb variables</p> </li> <li> <p>Whenever you <code>print</code> a variable in gdb, it prints this weird <code>$NN =</code> before it in the output:</p> </li> </ol> <pre><code>(gdb) p 5+5\n$1 = 10\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>This is actually a gdb variable, that you can use to reference that same variable any time later in your session:</li> </ol> <pre><code>(gdb) p $1\n$2 = 10\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>You can also assign your own variables for convenience, using <code>set</code>:</li> </ol> <pre><code>(gdb) set $foo = 4\n(gdb) p $foo\n$3 = 4\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>This can be useful to grab a reference to some complex expression or similar that you'll be referencing many times, or, for example, for simplicity in writing a conditional breakpoint (see tip 1).</p> </li> <li> <p>Register variables</p> </li> <li> <p>In addition to the numeric variables, and any variables you define, gdb exposes your machine's registers as pseudo-variables, including some cross-architecture aliases for common ones, like <code>$sp</code> for the the stack pointer, or <code>$pc</code> for the program counter or instruction pointer.</p> </li> <li> <p>These are most useful when debugging assembly code or code without debugging symbols. Combined with a knowledge of your machine's calling convention, for example, you can use these to inspect function parameters:</p> </li> </ol> <pre><code>(gdb) break write if $rsi == 2\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>will break on all writes to stderr on amd64, where the <code>$rsi</code> register is used to pass the first parameter.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <code>x</code> command</p> </li> <li> <p>Most people who've used gdb know about the <code>print</code> or <code>p</code> command, because of its obvious name, but I've been surprised how many don't know about the power of the <code>x</code> command.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>x</code> (for \"e x amine\") is used to output regions of memory in various formats. It takes two arguments in a slightly unusual syntax:</p> </li> </ol> <pre><code>x/FMT ADDRESS\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p><code>ADDRESS</code>, unsurprisingly, is the address to examine; It can be an arbitrary expression, like the argument to <code>print</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>FMT</code> controls how the memory should be dumped, and consists of (up to) three components:</p> <p>* A numeric COUNT of how many elements to dump   * A single-character FORMAT, indicating how to interpret and display each element   * A single-character SIZE, indicating the size of each element to display. <code>x</code> displays COUNT elements of length SIZE each, starting from ADDRESS, formatting them according to the FORMAT.</p> </li> </ol> <p>There are many valid \"format\" arguments; <code>help x</code> in gdb will give you the full list, so here's my favorites:</p> <p><code>x/x</code> displays elements in hex, <code>x/d</code> displays them as signed decimals, <code>x/c</code> displays characters, <code>x/i</code> disassembles memory as instructions, and <code>x/s</code> interprets memory as C strings.</p> <p>The SIZE argument can be one of: <code>b</code>, <code>h</code>, <code>w</code>, and <code>g</code>, for one-, two-, four-, and eight-byte blocks, respectively.</p> <p>If you have debug symbols so that GDB knows the types of everything you might want to inspect, <code>p</code> is usually a better choice, but if not, <code>x</code> is invaluable for taking a look at memory.</p> <pre><code>[~]$ grep saved_command /proc/kallsyms\nffffffff81946000 B saved_command_line\n\n(gdb) x/s 0xffffffff81946000\nffffffff81946000 &lt;&gt;:     \"root=/dev/sda1 quiet\"\n</code></pre> <p><code>x/i</code> is invaluable as a quick way to disassemble memory:</p> <pre><code>(gdb) x/5i schedule\n   0xffffffff8154804a &lt;schedule&gt;:   push   %rbp\n   0xffffffff8154804b &lt;schedule+1&gt;: mov    $0x11ac0,%rdx\n   0xffffffff81548052 &lt;schedule+8&gt;: mov    %gs:0xb588,%rax\n   0xffffffff8154805b &lt;schedule+17&gt;:    mov    %rsp,%rbp\n   0xffffffff8154805e &lt;schedule+20&gt;:    push   %r15\n</code></pre> <p>If I'm stopped at a segfault in unknown code, one of the first things I try is something like <code>x/20i $ip-40</code>, to get a look at what the code I'm stopped at looks like.</p> <p>A quick-and-dirty but surprisingly effective way to debug memory leaks is to let the leak grow until it consumes most of a program's memory, and then attach <code>gdb</code> and just <code>x</code> random pieces of memory. Since the leaked data is using up most of memory, you'll usually hit it pretty quickly, and can try to interpret what it must have come from.</p> <p>~ nelhage</p> <p>Ksplice is hiring!</p> <p>Do you love tinkering with, exploring, and debugging Linux systems?

Also, this will not work with a C++ vector, because it will dump the vector object's data members.</p> <p>Using the '@' symbol allows us to do both:</p> <p>(gdb) p *&amp;a[0]@10 $1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}</p> <p>This prints the first 10 elements in the vector. Looks ugly, but is not so complicated really: '&amp;a[0]' gets the address of the first element. '*' dereferences the address back to the vector's data type.
